      The LPGA Tour’s biggest star, World No. 1 Nelly Korda, had her biggest year yet in 2024, putting together an historic run of wins that included her second major title at the Chevron Championship. In all, Korda captured seven LPGA wins in the 2024 season, nearly doubling her career total to 15, along with 11 top-10 finishes in all. Now we know that all of that success has earned her another top-10 finish… as one of the top 10 highest-paid female athletes of 2024.Sportico.com recently released a ranking of the world’s highest earners in women’s sports, and Korda was featured in the No. 8 position, with an estimated earnings total of $14.4 million.

That sum includes the $4.4 million she earned on the course for her flood of victories, with the rest earned through endorsements.While Korda’s sum is impressive, especially given the small size of LPGA purses as compared to PGA Tour purses, it pales in comparison to the top-earner on the list, Coco Gauff.Gauff, the 20-year-old American tennis star, paired $9.4 million on-court earnings with $21 million in endorsements for a total exceeding $30 million, according to Sportico’s estimations.Interestingly, Sportico also records that WNBA superstar and avid golfer Caitlin Clark made $11 million in endorsement money in 2024, only $1 million more than Korda.And Korda isn’t the only pro golfer who makes an appearance on the list. LPGA pro Jeeno Thitikul comes in 12th place, thanks in large part to her $4 million paycheck for winning the CME Group Tour Championship. Veteran LPGA star and 2024 Olympic gold medalist Lydia Ko comes in 15th on the list, with $3.2 million earned on the course and $3.5 million earned off of it.For perspective, men’s World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler matched Korda’s total of seven victories in 2024. His total on-course earnings? More than $62 million.
