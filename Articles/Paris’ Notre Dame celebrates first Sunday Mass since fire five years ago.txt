Dec. 8, 2024, 1:27 PM ESTPARIS — Notes boomed from the meticulously cleaned grand organ, the choir’s voices echoed off of walls scrubbed clean of scorch marks, and light shone through restored stained glass windows.Hundreds flocked to Notre Dame’s first Sunday Mass since a fire ravaged the beloved landmark five years ago to mark the cathedral’s rebirth and witness the consecration of its altar.Archbishop of Paris Laurent Ulrich presided over the Mass, which was attended by French President Emmanuel Macron, who helped oversee the official reopening of the cathedral on Saturday in an evening of celebration and ceremony, and first lady Brigitte Macron.Nearly 170 bishops from France and around the world had been set to participate in Sunday’s Mass, along with one priest from each of the 106 parishes in the Diocese of Paris and one from each of the seven Eastern Catholic Churches. They were accompanied by faithful from within their communities.Members of the clergy arrive to attend Mass.Julien De Rosa / AFP - Getty ImagesThe robes worn during the morning mass were crafted by French fashion designer Jean-Charles Castelbajac and bore his signature style, boasting bold primary colors to convey the joy of the the day’s service.“I wanted something very pure,” Castelbajac said in the lead-up to the weekend’s celebrations.Archbishop of Paris Laurent Ulrich after the consecration of the new main altar.Julien De Rosa / AFP - Getty ImagesHe added that the rector-archpriest of Notre Dame, Monsignor Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, had asked that the robes reflect “nobility and simplicity.”“I did everything with my scissors. I didn’t draw. I cut,” he said, “to make it very pure.”Worshippers attend Sunday Mass in Notre Dame Cathedral.Julien De Rosa  / AFP - Getty ImagesThe inaugural Mass came after thousands of people lined the streets surrounding Notre Dame on Saturday night to watch as the Gothic masterpiece opened its doors to the public for the first time.

And in the wake of a powerful service, he said it was important to remember that while Notre Dame is a “religious place,” it is also “for the secular.”“I think everyone agrees between the nonreligious powers and the religious powers that the cathedral is sort of indistinctively open to everyone,” he said. “And that’s its nature.”Clergy members leave at the end of the inaugural Mass.Sarah Meyssonnier / Pool via APChantal Da SilvaChantal Da Silva reports on world news for NBC News Digital and is based in London.
