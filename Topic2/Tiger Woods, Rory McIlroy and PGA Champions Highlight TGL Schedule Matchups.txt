Morikawa is up again on Feb. 4 against Boston Common followed by a matchup versus Thomas and Atlanta Drive on Feb. 17. LA and the 2020 PGA Champion then lead off two double-headers: on Feb. 24 versus New York and March 3, their last match of the season, against The Bay.Keegan BradleyTalk about one busy guy in 2025. Bradley, the 2011 PGA Champion, is the U.S. Ryder Cup Captain next year and in between determining his squad, he'll join McIlroy as a part of Boston Common Golf Club. Bradley plays back-to-back weeks against Jupiter Links and Los Angeles Golf Club (Jan. 27 and Feb. 4), then plays three consecutive Mondays (Feb. 17, 24 and March 3) in a row vs The Bay, Atlanta Drive and New York Golf Club. Xander SchauffeleSaving our reigning champ for last. What a year for Xander Schauffele.Two major titles, including a PGA Championship at Valhalla, will be tough to beat in 2025 but TGL will be a good kick-off for the blossoming star. He's leading a New York Golf Club crew that kicks off the TGL season against The Bay on Jan. 7. Two weeks later, he'll go against his good friend Patrick Cantlay and Thomas of the Atlanta Drive on Jan. 21. New York takes a little break until a big-time match vs. Woods and Jupiter Links on Feb. 18, followed by another match 6 days later against Morikawa and LA. New York ends the season against their rivals (well, for most things) in Boston Common on March 3.
